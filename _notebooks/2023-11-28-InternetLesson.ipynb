    "- A catalyst in the formation of the Internet was the heating up of the Cold War. The Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite spurred the U.S. Defense Department to consider ways information could still be disseminated even after a nuclear attack.\n",
    "- ARPANET was created in 1969 and provided the foundation for what came to be known as the Internet\n",
    "- January 1, 1983 is the official birthday of the modern internet"
