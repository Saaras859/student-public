# Preparing for the Big Test: A Strategic Study Plan

As a high school student gearing up for an important 60 multiple-choice question (MCQ) test, I've devised a meticulous study plan to ensure my success. My strategy involves utilizing College Board videos to review the material comprehensively. Here's how I plan to tackle this challenge over the next week:

## **Day 1 - Day 5: Review with College Board Videos**

For the next five days, my focus will be on watching College Board videos to review the test material. Each day, I've planned to space out my study sessions, ensuring effective learning and retention.

- **Day 1:** I'll watch the first set of videos, covering specific topics of the test.
- **Day 2:** Continuing from where I left off, I'll dive into the next batch of videos, deepening my understanding.
- **Day 3:** The third day will involve more video reviews, focusing on areas where I feel less confident.
- **Day 4:** I'll review additional videos, clarifying any doubts and reinforcing my knowledge.
- **Day 5:** On the final day of video review, I'll go through the remaining topics, ensuring a comprehensive grasp of the content.

## **Day 6: Test Day**

Armed with the knowledge gained from the College Board videos, I'll tackle the 60 MCQ test with confidence. Taking the test will be a culmination of my dedicated efforts in preparation.

## **Post-Test Strategy: Making Test Corrections**

After completing the test, my learning doesn't stop there. I plan to engage in a thorough review of my answers, focusing on the questions I found challenging. Here's my approach to making test corrections:

- **Step 1:** I'll carefully go through each question, analyzing my initial response and understanding the correct answer.
- **Step 2:** For every incorrect answer, I'll identify the concept or topic related to the question.
- **Step 3:** I'll review the corresponding College Board video or study material to understand the concept better.
- **Step 4:** After gaining a deeper insight, I'll reattempt the incorrect questions, ensuring I can answer them correctly.

By diligently following this process, I aim not only to correct my mistakes but also to reinforce my understanding of the concepts. This methodical approach to test corrections will serve as a valuable learning experience, helping me improve my knowledge and performance in future assessments.

Wish me luck as I embark on this journey of intense review and strategic test preparation!
