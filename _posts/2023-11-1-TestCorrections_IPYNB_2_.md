The reason why I got this question wrong is because I interpreted the right as left here for this scenario. But, if we were to plug in the answer I put down here we would end up at coordinates (3,2). Because we are not supposed to be moving right there but instead left. The correct answer here is B because when we move right 3 three times we are able to switch our direction from right to left allowing me to achieve succes by moving to the correct square. This question was a silly mistake on my part to fix it next time I will better read the questiona and double check my answer before rushing.

The reason why I got this question wrong is simply because I didnt know what lossy transformations or what lossless transformations were. But I now know in byte pair encoding, character pairs are replaced with new characters, but the mapping of these pairs to replacement characters is preserved. This means that the original string can be reconstructed from the encoded string using the same mapping, making it a lossless transformation. Lossless transformations ensure that no data is lost during the encoding and decoding process. To not get this wrong from now on I can review this blog and make sure I can put this new vocabulary in future blogs.

The reason that I got this question wrong is because I simply didnt understand what a logic gate truly was. I understand how the question works now and its due basically if I have starting with True False on the left side it will output False because both of them just arent True then I take a look at the right side where I have false false and due to it being an or operation and not seeing any trues taht will also result false so in the end the output becomes false. Next time to review I can better read the question and make a better system approach to guessing.

The reason why I gott this question wrong is because I misread the question and got baited by the wording. The reason it works ie because both of themm are still doing the same thing in the end because my sum is never getting changed by the avg function and it just keeps processing it for no reason whereas I can just do that at the end. But, I accidentally picked D over C heer which was a fumble on my part because as we can see here segment 2 requires far less steps with per iteration. To fix this next time I can make it so that I read the question more thoroughly and double check my answer.

What went wrong here is I didnt understand the questione because I forgot what abstraction was and I didnt read the complexity aspect of the question as I was rushing through. So, the reasont that the answers are right here is because the instances getting replaced with a call to a procedure makes the code a lot smaller and less cluttered making it easier to read by adding functions elsewhere perhaps together to reduce clutter in the main area of the code. And, making documentation shorter and in pieces allows for more detailed understanding of each piece of code. To solve this next time I learned about abstraction.
