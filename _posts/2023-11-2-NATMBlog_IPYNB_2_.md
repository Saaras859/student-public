Criteria/Key Features/Technicals Checkbox: Frontend, APIs, Backend, Agile  
3.6 to 4 pts. HOOK! Key features achieved (shown in running demo to graders), 1 minute show  
3.6 to 4 pts. KNOWLEGE, HOW IT IS MADE! Key features blogged (shown in demo time to graders), 2 minute show  
0.6 to 1 pt.  VALUE. Most useful or valuable aspect of project.  
Austins Group:
- Had a functional weather app was very unique didnt see any other projects like it, unfortunately they didnt get up their feature's due to the backend crash so I cannot grade it 
- It was made supposedly using a weather api that they called from and then utilizing it they were able to predict weather trend's and then using a seperate api that they had built in thier fronted they were able to display the temperature actively.(3.8) because its very unique but isnt as hard to implement very cool to display
- Had a very nice UI and was definitely something I would be willing to use, especially if it worked with the 5 year prediction graph of weather 1/1
- Overall I would give it a 4.8/5 I excluded key features because a lot of it wasnt working unfortunately due to the backend crash.
Hanlun's Group:
- I thought it was very unique how they were able to get chess up and working specifically through Yeongsu Demo was relatively elegant. Unfortunately it was extremely laggy at the event but in class I was able to view it and it worked amazing so I would give it a 4/4. The Whisp chatting system was also very elegant with it looking like discord or similar and having a nice UI that I could see myself using. So overall I give it a 4/4.
- I would say the how it was made is also unique because its able to communicate move changes to aws via post requests and then using get requests displays the move on the other user's side to make a functional chess game which I think is super unique. And the whisp I think its cool how they are able to edit the database by typing in a url which allows them to clear it allowing for a nice set of moderation etc. (4/4)
- I would say applicationally its a 0.8 because I dont think the whisp is good enough without some key features like user managament etc. But the chess game is very well developed and usable.
- Overall I would give it a 8.8/9
Advik's Group:
- I thought the appeal was funny had a clear group they were attending to, made a nice hook with a breaking bad theme. I also thought the song finder concept was good although it didnt work because the server crashed and the breaking bad simulator was also pretty fun and hilarious to look at 4/4.
- I think the knowledge is also pretty cool with them housing a backend, that effectively communicated with their frontend for there music, which was unable to work but with there code you could see the get requests working effectively. So I would give it a 4/4.
- I think that the usability of it is where the project again lack's because the UI is not done extremely well, which I think can be fixed with some more focus on frontend over features. However I do like that it does work so with some touchup it could be amazing. 0.7/1
- I would give it in all a 8.7/9
